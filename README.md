# StoneAgeGame
A school project that I made as part of a 4–person team, over the course of 1 month. It is a 2D sprite-based linear narrative game, set in the Danish Stone Age and made with Unity 6000.0.41f1. It was done in collaboration with The National Museum of Denmark, as a gamified installation to attract a younger audience to their stone age exhibition. It worked as part 1 of the exhibition experience, where part 2 was a VR game developed with Unreal Engine.

## Our roles on the team were as follows:

Aria Myrivili — Game director and producer

Bjørn Troldahl (me) — Lead programmer

Yuhan Liu — Sound designer, music composer and assistant programmer

Zhangxian Rao — Art director and 2D artist
