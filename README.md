# StoneAgeGame
A school project that I made as part of a 4–person team, over the course of 1 month. It is a 2D sprite-based linear narrative game, set in the Danish Stone Age and made with Unity 6000.0.41f1. It was done in collaboration with The National Museum of Denmark, as an interactive and gamified installation to attract a younger audience to their stone age exhibition. It works as part 1 of the exhibition experience, where part 2 was a VR game developed with Unreal Engine.

## Our roles on the team were as follows:

Aria Myrivili — Game director and producer

Bjørn Troldahl (me) — Lead programmer

Yuhan Liu — Sound designer, music composer and assistant programmer

Zhangxian Rao — Art director and 2D artist
